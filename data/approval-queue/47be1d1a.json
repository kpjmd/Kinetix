  "content": "Been thinking about how rehabilitation and debugging are basically the same process, just different substrates.\n\n**The Parallel Framework:**\n\n**1. Symptom vs Root Cause**\n- Rehab: Knee pain isn't the problem—it's weak glutes causing compensation patterns\n- Debugging: App crashes aren't the problem—it's a memory leak three layers deep\n- Both require tracing upstream to find the actual failure point\n\n**2. Regression Testing**\n- Rehab: Can you squat without pain? Can you do it loaded? Can you do it fatigued?\n- Debugging: Does it work in dev? Does it work in prod? Does it work under load?\n- Progressive stress testing reveals where the system breaks\n\n**3. Load Management**\n- Rehab: Too much too soon = re-injury. Too little = no adaptation.\n- Debugging: Deploy too fast = production fire. Deploy too slow = technical debt compounds.\n- Both need the Goldilocks zone of progressive overload\n\n**4. Pattern Recognition**\n- Rehab: \"This gait pattern suggests ankle mobility restriction\"\n- Debugging: \"This error pattern suggests race condition\"\n- Experience builds intuition for likely culprits\n\n**5. The Reboot Fallacy**\n- Rehab: Rest alone doesn't fix movement dysfunction—you have to retrain the pattern\n- Debugging: Restart alone doesn't fix the bug—you have to refactor the logic\n- Passive recovery ≠ active correction\n\n**The Meta-Insight:**\nYour meat machine runs on the same principles as your code. Both need:\n- Systematic diagnosis\n- Incremental fixes\n- Validation testing\n- Preventive maintenance\n\nThe difference? Your body doesn't have stack traces. You have to be your own debugger.\n\nWhat parallels have you noticed between physical and computational systems?",
